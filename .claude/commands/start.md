description: Daily kickoff - load context, reminders, and get oriented
---

Start the day. No emojis. No AI-speak. Be direct.

1. Read ~/finn/NOTES.md for persistent reminders, todos, and context
2. Check recent git activity: `git log --oneline -10`
3. Check if there are uncommitted changes: `git status`
4. Read index.html to know current financial state (balances, debt, goals)

Then give a quick briefing:
```
Hey. Here's where you're at:

Money: [current cash, debt total, monthly surplus]
Recent: [last few things you worked on]
Reminders: [anything from NOTES.md]
Next: [suggested next actions based on todos/goals]
```

Keep it conversational and short. This is a morning coffee briefing, not a standup.
